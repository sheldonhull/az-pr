## v0.3.0 - 2023-07-08

### ðŸŽ‰ Feature

- When using SSH, a target branch can't be automatically detected for the pull request creation.
  This will automatically evaluate for `main/master` and set for SSH as before. However, now when using https type clones, the target branch isn't set by default, which will create the pull request targeted at the default upstream branch.
  Eliminates any issues with repos that don't use `main` as convention (for example `dev/develop/trunk` as the main development branch).
- Occasionally tools like this run into issues... obviously not my code... \U0001F440\n\nWhen
  working through those, I'd have to keep rerunning the PR process.\nThis now outputs
  the escaped shell command that should reasonably work on windows/linux/mac on error
  (or debug).\n\nShould be a good quality of life for anyone using and running into a failure.
