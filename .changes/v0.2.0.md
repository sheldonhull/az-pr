## v0.2.0 - 2023-02-16

### ðŸŽ‰ Feature

- When running `az-pr` by itself, it uses boa (powered by Bubbletea from Charm) to allow exploration of the subcommands and help content.
  This might be replaced later, but is a nice experiment for better user exploration without running `--help` on every level of subcommand.
- Link workitems via `az-pr new`.
  This runs a post step after creation due to limitations on the azure-cli to associate work-items on a created pull request.
  Whatever is linked will be automatically set to complete once the pull request is merged.
  Additionally, allow selection of draft true/false when creating.
- Enter into confetty mode after running. Rough work in progress, so press ctrl+c to exit after it triggers.
  Why? The world needs more confetty and tacos.
