## v0.4.0 - 2024-03-12

### 🎉 Feature

- When you choose the commit type, git history for last `n` months (set to 6 months currently), is evaluated and the top used scope for that commit type is presuggested. To accept, just press right arrow.

### 🔨 Refactor

- Migrate from pterm input to using `huh` a new charm library that provides a form that can allow toggling back and forth on the form as a normal TUI, allowing edits before submitting. This reduces some of the validation logic as well, but minor compromises made overall.

### ⬆️ Dependencies

- Remove go toolchain reference as this causes failure from go install with earlier versions of go.
