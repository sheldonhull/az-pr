## v0.1.3 - 2023-02-13

### 🔨 Refactor

- The output from the azure-cli is now captured and parsed to construct a clickable url in the terminal output for the pull request. This helps support cases where the environment doesn't work with the azure-cli `--open` flag, such as devcontainers, remote ssh, and other remote environments.

### 🐛 Bug Fix

- Fix output formatting that was using println without formatting directive in `init()` command.
