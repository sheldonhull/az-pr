### ðŸ”¨ Refactor

- SSH support was weak.
  While it would detect the upstream branch, the detection logic for repository name and project don't work on SSH cloned repos.
  Now the project name and repo name will be extracted for repos that follow the normal `dev.azure.com` structure.
  No support for `visualstudio.com` based references since you can use `dev.azure.com` style format with those anyway.
