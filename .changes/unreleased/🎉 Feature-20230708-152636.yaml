  Occasionally tools like this run into issues... obviously not my code... \U0001F440\n\nWhen
  working through those, I'd have to keep rerunning the PR process.\nThis now outputs
  the escaped shell command that should reasonably work on windows/linux/mac on error
  (or debug).\n\nShould be a good quality of life for anyone using and running into a failure.
