## v0.1.1 - 2023-02-10

### 🔨 Refactor

- Made `Ctrl+C` termination output a warning instead of nasty red error messages. After all, I care about the user.
- Add mention of `az-pr check` at the top so that required environment variable is correctly configured. I might revisit the login method later to see if I can use SSO login with cli and not require the token. I've just done the token approach for so long and know it works. Will come back round eventually to that.
- Use bubbleteam multi-line input for the PR description, as it's a better editing experience. Survey is nice, but default template overhangs the same line and doesn't feel as nice.

## v0.1.0 - 2023-02-09

### 🎉 Feature

- Initial release.
- Supports installation of azure cli for macOS & Linux.
- Detects branch `master` or `main` and if it can't find it, will prompt for input.

## v0.0.1 - 2023-02-08

### 🤖 Development

- In progress. Initial check, init commands complete. The `new` command is not yet finished, requiring the invoking of the cli.
